# tip
Bayesian Clustering Using the Table Invitation Prior (TIP). TIP allows clustering without supplying the number of clusters, and may incoprorate different types of likelihood functions. If the use of a likelihood function is not desired, then a constant likelihood function may be used (i.e., the likelihood has no effect since it always returns the same constant).
